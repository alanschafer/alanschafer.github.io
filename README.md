# Hi, I'm Älan von Schäfer 👋

Independent researcher and writer exploring the depths of belief, trauma, and deconstruction. I like to examine the mind, memory, and meaning itself through both analytical research and creative storytelling.

## About Me

I'm a peer-reviewed investigator who focuses on the intersection of psychology, faith, and human experience. My work dives into complex questions about how we believe, why we doubt, and what happens when our foundational beliefs shift.

## Here Are My Works

I've written several pieces that explore these themes from different angles:

**📖 [Deconstruction](https://alanschafer.github.io/Deconstruction/)**
An analysis of biblical proportions

**🧠 [The Believing Brain](https://alanschafer.github.io/TheBelievingBrain-/)**
An up-close look at what parts of the brain produce belief

**💬 [Interview with a Deconstructionist](https://alanschafer.github.io/Interview/)**
Navigating the waters of doubt

**🛤️ [The Third Path](https://alanschafer.github.io/thirdpath/)**
A tragic end of a family in the name of faith. Mira's journey through the trials

**🎭 [The 2ND Artifact](https://alanschafer.github.io/Shorts/)**
The mask that ate the face, a tale of trauma fueled amnesia

## Check Them Out

Each work offers a unique perspective on the journey of questioning and understanding. Whether you're interested in the science of belief, personal narratives of faith transitions, or creative explorations of trauma and memory, there's something here for you.
